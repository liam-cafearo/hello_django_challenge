# Hello Django Challenge

Below outlines the challenge laid out by Code Institute

## Challenge

The challenge is to create a Django app with three views:

- Home
- About
- Contact

### Home Page

Has a simple message telling the user what day it is.

### About

Contains some information about the site.

### Contact

Will contain first name, last name and telephone number. I have used made up details as I don't want to post mine to the general public.
